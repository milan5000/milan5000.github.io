Hello! My name is Daniel Milan; I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, double majoring in computational engineering and mathematics. I particularly enjoy autonomous systems, operations research, high-performance computing, and machine learning, though my academic interests span a much wider range including space technology, computer systems, embedded systems, networking, and more.

I am a member of the [Texas Rocket Engineering Lab](https://texasrocketlab.ae.utexas.edu/), in which I design and develop software for the flight computer and ground support equipment. I also help with [research](/publications/) conducted within the [Autonomous Systems Group](https://autonomy.oden.utexas.edu/Groups/autonomous-systems-group). In my spare time, I also enjoy working on technically interesting [projects](/portfolio/).

When I'm not doing that, you can probably find me practicing the piano, working on my photography, playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends, or simply reading a nice book.

Feel free to check out my work here or on other sites, and drop me a message if you have any questions or want to share something interesting!
